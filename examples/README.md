## Helper scripts

* rg.pl: Generates a pseudorandom graph to `stdout` in a `.param` Essence format.
* gc2ms.pl: Generates a MaxSAT encoding to check for connectivity in graphs generated by `rg.pl`
* gc2s.pl: Generates a SAT encoding to check for connectivity in graphs generated by `rg.pl`
* mknew: Given a number of vertices and a seed, creates a new graph using `rg.pl`. By using `gc2ms.pl` and `gc2s.pl` checks its connectivity using `open-wbo` and `lingeling` and finally stores it either in the `dis` or `con` directories if it is disconnected or connected.
